# ðŸ”§ Cron-Job.org DNS Error Solutions

## ðŸŽ¯ Issue Analysis
Your Supabase URL is working correctly (resolves to `104.18.38.10`), but cron-job.org is having DNS lookup issues. This is a common problem with cron-job.org.

## ðŸš€ Solution Options

### Option 1: Try Alternative Cron Services (Recommended)

#### A. EasyCron (Better DNS Resolution)
1. **Go to**: [https://www.easycron.com/](https://www.easycron.com/)
2. **Create account** (free tier available)
3. **Use same configuration**:
   - **URL**: `https://mapgmmiobityxaaevomp.supabase.co/functions/v1/loan-polling`
   - **Method**: POST
   - **Headers**: Same as cron-job.org
   - **Schedule**: `*/10 * * * *`

#### B. SetCronJob
1. **Go to**: [https://www.setcronjob.com/](https://www.setcronjob.com/)
2. **Create account** (free tier available)
3. **Same configuration** as above

### Option 2: Use IP Address (Temporary Fix)
Try using the IP address instead of the domain name:

**URL**: `https://104.18.38.10/functions/v1/loan-polling`

**Note**: This might cause SSL certificate issues, but worth trying.

### Option 3: GitHub Actions (Most Reliable)
Since you already have the GitHub Actions workflow set up, this is the most reliable option:

1. **Add Secret to GitHub**:
   - Go to your GitHub repo â†’ Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
   - Add `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` with your service role key

2. **Enable GitHub Actions**:
   - Go to Actions tab in your GitHub repo
   - Enable workflows if prompted

3. **Test Manually**:
   - Go to Actions â†’ Loan Polling workflow
   - Click "Run workflow" to test

### Option 4: Fix Cron-Job.org DNS Issue

#### Try These Variations:
1. **Different URL Format**:
   ```
   https://mapgmmiobityxaaevomp.supabase.co/functions/v1/loan-polling/
   ```
   (Note the trailing slash)

2. **Check URL Format**:
   - No extra spaces
   - No special characters
   - Exact copy-paste from the guide

3. **Try Different DNS Settings**:
   - Some cron services allow custom DNS servers
   - Try using Google DNS (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1)
