# üîß Cron-Job.org DNS Lookup Error - Troubleshooting Guide

## üéØ Issue
Your Supabase URL is working perfectly (we just tested it successfully), but cron-job.org is getting a "DNS lookup" error.

## ‚úÖ Confirmed Working
- ‚úÖ **Supabase URL**: `https://mapgmmiobityxaaevomp.supabase.co/functions/v1/loan-polling`
- ‚úÖ **Edge Function**: Responding with 200 OK
- ‚úÖ **Authentication**: Working correctly
- ‚úÖ **Function Logic**: Found 100 loans, processed correctly

## üîß Solutions to Try

### Solution 1: Check URL Format in Cron-Job.org
Make sure your URL in cron-job.org is **exactly**:
```
https://mapgmmiobityxaaevomp.supabase.co/functions/v1/loan-polling
```

**Common mistakes:**
- ‚ùå Extra spaces before/after URL
- ‚ùå Trailing slash: `https://...loan-polling/`
- ‚ùå Missing `https://`
- ‚ùå Typos in the URL

### Solution 2: Try Different DNS Settings
In cron-job.org, try these alternative approaches:

#### Option A: Use IP Address (if available)
1. Check your Supabase dashboard for the IP address
2. Use the IP instead of the domain name

#### Option B: Use Different URL Format
Try these variations:
```
https://mapgmmiobityxaaevomp.supabase.co/functions/v1/loan-polling
https://mapgmmiobityxaaevomp.supabase.co/functions/v1/loan-polling/
```

### Solution 3: Check Cron-Job.org Settings
1. **Timeout**: Set to 60+ seconds
2. **User Agent**: Leave empty or use default
3. **Follow Redirects**: Enable if available
4. **SSL Verification**: Enable

### Solution 4: Alternative Cron Services
If cron-job.org continues to have DNS issues, try these alternatives:

#### A. EasyCron
- URL: https://www.easycron.com/
- Similar setup process
- Often better DNS resolution

#### B. SetCronJob
- URL: https://www.setcronjob.com/
- Good reliability
- Free tier available

#### C. GitHub Actions (Free)
Create a GitHub Action that runs every 10 minutes:
```yaml
name: Loan Polling
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/10 * * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  poll-loans:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Trigger Loan Polling
        run: |
          curl -X POST "https://mapgmmiobityxaaevomp.supabase.co/functions/v1/loan-polling" \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY }}" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d "{}"
```

### Solution 5: Use Your Own Server
If you have a server, set up a simple cron job:
```bash
# Add to crontab (crontab -e)
*/10 * * * * curl -X POST "https://mapgmmiobityxaaevomp.supabase.co/functions/v1/loan-polling" -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{}"
```

## üß™ Testing Steps

### 1. Test URL Manually
```bash
curl -X POST "https://mapgmmiobityxaaevomp.supabase.co/functions/v1/loan-polling" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{}"
```

### 2. Check DNS Resolution
```bash
nslookup mapgmmiobityxaaevomp.supabase.co
```

### 3. Test from Different Locations
- Try from your local machine
- Try from a different network
- Use online tools like https://www.whatsmydns.net/

## üìã Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Double-check** the URL format in cron-job.org
2. **Try EasyCron** as an alternative (often better DNS)
3. **Set up GitHub Actions** as a backup (free and reliable)

### Long-term Solutions:
1. **Monitor** which service works best
2. **Set up alerts** for failed executions
3. **Consider** using multiple cron services for redundancy

## üéØ Quick Fix - GitHub Actions Setup

If you want to get this working immediately, here's a GitHub Actions setup:

### 1. Create `.github/workflows/loan-polling.yml`:
```yaml
name: Loan Polling
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/10 * * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  poll-loans:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Trigger Loan Polling
        run: |
          curl -X POST "https://mapgmmiobityxaaevomp.supabase.co/functions/v1/loan-polling" \
            -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY }}" \
            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
            -d "{}"
```

### 2. Add Secret to GitHub:
- Go to your GitHub repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets
- Add `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` with your service role key

### 3. Enable Actions:
- Go to Actions tab in your GitHub repo
- Enable workflows if prompted

## üéâ Expected Results

After implementing any of these solutions, you should see:
- ‚úÖ **Successful executions** every 10 minutes
- ‚úÖ **Loan discovery** from Mifos X
- ‚úÖ **Auto-disbursements** when configured
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive logging** in Supabase

## üìû Support

If you continue to have issues:
1. Try the GitHub Actions approach (most reliable)
2. Use EasyCron as an alternative to cron-job.org
3. Check if your network has any restrictions

The important thing is that your Edge Function is working perfectly - we just need to find a reliable way to trigger it every 10 minutes!
