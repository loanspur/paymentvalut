# Logo File Missing Fix

## üîç Issue: Logo Image 400 Error

The error:
```
GET http://localhost:3000/_next/image?url=%2Feazzypay-logo.png&w=256&q=75 400 (Bad Request)
```

This happens because:
1. The logo file `/eazzypay-logo.png` doesn't exist in the `public/` folder
2. Next.js Image Optimization is trying to optimize a non-existent file

## ‚úÖ Fix Applied

### 1. **Improved Error Handling**
- Added `unoptimized={true}` to skip Next.js image optimization for missing files
- Better error fallback that shows text instead of broken image
- Added icon fallback for collapsed sidebar

### 2. **Graceful Fallback**
- When logo fails to load, shows "eazzypay" text instead
- When sidebar is collapsed, shows `DollarSign` icon if logo is missing
- No console errors, just graceful fallback

## üìÅ To Fix Permanently

### Option 1: Add Logo File (Recommended)

1. **Place logo file in public folder:**
   ```
   public/eazzypay-logo.png
   ```

2. **File should be:**
   - PNG format
   - Recommended size: 280x72px (for 140x36 with 2x retina)
   - Or any size that looks good when resized

3. **Commit to git:**
   ```bash
   git add public/eazzypay-logo.png
   git commit -m "Add eazzypay logo"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Option 2: Use Existing Icon (Current Fix)

The code now gracefully falls back to:
- Text: "eazzypay" when logo is missing (expanded sidebar)
- Icon: `DollarSign` icon when logo is missing (collapsed sidebar)

This works fine, but having a logo file is better for branding.

## üß™ Testing

### Before Fix:
- ‚ùå Console errors about missing logo
- ‚ùå 400 errors in network tab
- ‚ùå Broken image placeholder

### After Fix:
- ‚úÖ No console errors
- ‚úÖ Graceful fallback to text/icon
- ‚úÖ No network errors (or errors are handled silently)

## üìù Notes

- The `unoptimized={true}` prop bypasses Next.js Image Optimization
- This is fine for local development
- For production, it's better to have the actual logo file
- The fallback ensures the UI still works even without the logo

## üéØ Current Status

The code now:
- ‚úÖ Handles missing logo gracefully
- ‚úÖ Shows text fallback when logo is missing
- ‚úÖ Shows icon fallback when sidebar is collapsed
- ‚úÖ No console errors

To fully resolve:
- Add `public/eazzypay-logo.png` file
- The code will automatically use it once it exists
