# SMS Management System Enhancements

## 🎉 Overview

The SMS management system has been completely enhanced with modern UI/UX improvements, replacing all JavaScript popup alerts with meaningful toast notifications and adding comprehensive loading states to all action buttons.

## ✅ What Was Enhanced

- ✅ Manual dismiss with X button
- ✅ Stacked notifications support
- ✅ Responsive design

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
const { addToast } = useToast()

addToast({
  type: 'success',
  title: 'SMS Settings Saved',
  message: 'SMS settings have been saved successfully'
})
```

### 2. ⏳ Loading Button Components

**Created Components:**
- `components/LoadingButton.tsx` - Comprehensive loading button system
- Multiple variants: Primary, Secondary, Danger, Success, Warning
- Multiple sizes: Small, Medium, Large

**Features:**
- ✅ Loading spinner animation

</LoadingButton>
```

### 3. 🚫 Confirmation Dialog System

**Features:**
- ✅ Multiple variants (danger, warning, info)

  onConfirm: () => deleteSettings()
})
```

## 📋 Before vs After

### Before (JavaScript Popups)
```javascript
// Old way - blocking and unprofessional
alert('SMS settings saved successfully')
if (confirm('Are you sure you want to delete?')) {
  // delete logic
}
```

### After (Modern UI Components)
```typescript
// New way - non-blocking and professional
addToast({
  type: 'success',
  title: 'SMS Settings Saved',
  message: 'SMS settings have been saved successfully'
})

confirm({
  title: 'Delete SMS Settings',
  message: 'Are you sure you want to delete these SMS settings?',
  variant: 'danger',
  onConfirm: () => deleteSettings()
})
```
