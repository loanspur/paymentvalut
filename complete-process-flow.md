   - System fetches all loan products from Mifos X
   - Partner selects which products to enable for auto-disbursement
   - System stores product configuration with limits

#### **Step 2: Approved Loan Detection**

3. Filters loans for enabled products only
4. Extracts: client phone, amount, loan account, client name

**Option B: Webhook Notifications**

2. When loan is approved, Mifos X sends webhook to Payment Vault
3. System receives webhook with loan details
4. Validates webhook and processes loan

#### **Step 3: Wallet Balance Check (Charges Only)**

   - Deducts charges from partner wallet (NOT loan amount)
2. If M-Pesa failure:
   - Logs failure reason
