# Fix AirTouch Credentials - Final Solution

## 🚨 Problem Identified

**Error**: `1006 - INVALID CREDENTIALS`  
**Issue**: AirTouch API credentials are not valid, causing SMS sending to fail

## 🔧 Solution Steps

### Step 1: Get Valid AirTouch Credentials

1. **Contact AirTouch Support**
   - Email: support@airtouch.co.ke
   - Phone: Check their website for current contact details
   - Ask them to verify your account status and provide correct credentials

2. **Check Your AirTouch Account**
   - Log into your AirTouch dashboard
   - Verify your account is active and not suspended
   - Check if your API credentials are correct

3. **Get New Credentials**
   - Request new API username and password
   - Verify your sender ID is registered
   - Check your account balance

### Step 2: Update SMS Settings

1. **Go to SMS Settings Page**
   - Navigate to `/admin/sms-settings`
   - Find the SMS settings for your partner

2. **Edit SMS Settings**
   - Click "Edit" on the SMS settings
   - Update the following fields with **valid** AirTouch credentials:
     - **Username**: Enter your correct AirTouch API username
     - **Password**: Enter your correct AirTouch API password
     - **Sender ID**: Update if needed (or keep "LoanSpur" if it's valid)

3. **Save Settings**
   - Click "Save" to update the credentials
   - The system will encrypt and store the new credentials

### Step 3: Test the Fix

1. **Create Test Campaign**
   - Go to SMS Campaigns page
   - Create a new campaign with a real phone number
   - Send the campaign

2. **Verify Results**
   - Check that campaign status shows "completed"
   - Verify SMS notifications show "sent" status
   - Check that you receive the SMS on your phone

## 🔍 Why This Happens

### The Process:
1. ✅ **Create Campaign**: Works (no API call)
2. ✅ **Update Status to "sending"**: Works (database update)
3. ✅ **Show Success Toast**: Works (frontend assumes success)
4. ❌ **Call AirTouch API**: Fails (1006 - INVALID CREDENTIALS)
5. ❌ **Update Status to "failed"**: Happens after refresh

### The Issue:
- **Frontend**: Shows success toast immediately
- **Backend**: Tries to send SMS but fails due to invalid credentials
- **Result**: Status changes to "failed" after refresh

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

After updating credentials:

1. **Test AirTouch API**
   ```bash
   node test-airtouch-api-detailed.js
   ```
   - Should show `1000` (success) instead of `1006` (invalid credentials)

2. **Test SMS Campaign**
   - Create a new campaign
   - Send it
   - Should show "completed" status
   - Should receive SMS on your phone

## 📱 Expected Results After Fix

- ✅ **AirTouch API Response**: `1000` (success) instead of `1006` (invalid credentials)
- ✅ **Campaign Status**: "completed" instead of "failed"
- ✅ **SMS Notifications**: "sent" status with valid reference
- ✅ **SMS Delivery**: You receive the SMS on your phone
- ✅ **No More Race Condition**: Status stays "completed" after refresh

## 🚨 Alternative Solutions

### If You Can't Get Valid AirTouch Credentials:

1. **Use Different SMS Provider**
   - Consider other SMS providers like:
     - Africa's Talking
     - SMS Gateway API
     - Twilio
   - Update the SMS sending code to use the new provider

2. **Test Mode**
   - The system has a test mode that simulates SMS sending
   - This allows you to test the system without real SMS delivery

## 🎯 Summary

1. ✅ **Get valid AirTouch credentials** from AirTouch support
2. ✅ **Update SMS settings** with correct credentials
