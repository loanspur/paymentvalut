# 🔄 Redeploy Loan Polling Edge Function

## 🐛 Issue Found
The Edge Function is working but has a small issue with `Buffer` not being defined in the Deno environment.

## 🔧 Fix Applied
Changed from:
```typescript
const basicAuth = Buffer.from(`${partner.mifos_username}:${partner.mifos_password}`).toString('base64')
```

To:
```typescript
const basicAuth = btoa(`${partner.mifos_username}:${partner.mifos_password}`)
```

## 📋 Redeployment Steps

### Option 1: Using Supabase CLI
```bash
supabase functions deploy loan-polling
```

### Option 2: Using Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions → loan-polling
2. Click "Edit"
3. Replace the content with the updated code from `supabase/functions/loan-polling/index.ts`
4. Click "Deploy"

## 🧪 Test After Redeployment
```bash
node test-deployed-loan-polling.js
```

## ✅ Expected Results
After redeployment, you should see:
- ✅ **Edge Function**: 200 OK
