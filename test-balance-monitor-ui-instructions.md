# Test Balance Monitor After ABC Partner Removal

## ✅ **ABC Partner Successfully Removed!**

The test confirms that:
- ✅ ABC BAL Limited has been completely removed
- ✅ Finsafe Limited and Kulman Group Limited remain active
- ✅ Both remaining partners are properly configured for M-Pesa

## 🧪 **Test Balance Monitor from UI**

### **Step 1: Go to Transaction Monitoring Page**
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/transactions`
2. You should see only 2 partners now (Finsafe Limited and Kulman Group Limited)

### **Step 2: Trigger Balance Check**
1. Click the **"Trigger Balance Check"** button
2. Wait for the process to complete (up to 40 seconds)
3. Watch for toast notifications about the progress

### **Step 3: Check Results**
1. Look at the "Current Balance" column
2. Check if balance data appears for both partners
3. Verify the "Last Checked" timestamp is recent

### **Step 4: Monitor Supabase Logs**
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to **Functions → balance-monitor**
3. Check the logs for:
   - ✅ Successful credential retrieval
   - ✅ M-Pesa API calls
   - ✅ Callback responses
   - ❌ Any error messages

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

Since the disburse function is working perfectly with the same credentials, the balance monitor should now:

1. **✅ Successfully authenticate** with Safaricom for both partners
2. **✅ Make balance check requests** to Safaricom's Account Balance API
3. **✅ Receive callbacks** with balance data
4. **✅ Display fresh balance information** in the UI

## 🔍 **What to Look For**

### **Success Indicators:**
- ✅ Balance check completes without errors
- ✅ Fresh balance data appears in the UI
- ✅ No "No Data" messages in the balance column
- ✅ Logs show successful M-Pesa API calls

### **Error Indicators:**
- ❌ Balance check fails with credential errors
- ❌ No balance data appears after check
- ❌ Logs show M-Pesa API failures
- ❌ "No Data" still appears in balance column

## 🚨 **If Issues Persist**

If the balance monitor still doesn't work:
1. **Check the logs** in Supabase Functions dashboard
2. **Compare with disburse function** logs to see the difference
3. **Verify credentials** are properly stored for both partners
4. **Test with a single partner** first to isolate issues

The balance monitor now uses the exact same credential approach as the working disburse function, so it should work properly! 🎯
